original spec and the Github-flavored

__Markdown__ 
info page.

This ~~Cheatsheet~~ is specifically Markdown Here's version of Github-flavored Markdown. 
This differs slightly in styling and syntax from what Github uses, 
so what you see below might vary a little from what you get in a Markdown Here email, 
but it should be pretty close.

some text [link](https://google.com)
[link to help.md](./help.md)

Sometimes you don't want to convert the entire email; 
sometimes your email isn't entirely Markdown. 
To convert only part of the email, select the text (with your mouse or keyboard), 
right-click on it, and click the "Markdown Toggle" menu item. 
Your selection is magically rendered into pretty HTML.

To revert back to [Markdown][1],
just put your cursor anywhere in the block of converted text, 
right click, and click the "Markdown Toggle" menu item again. 
Now it's magically back to the original Markdown.
